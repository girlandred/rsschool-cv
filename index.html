            <p>I am a young software developer with a skill for working hard to get
            the best results. 
            My main achievement in my 19 years is solving
            quadratic equations with Vieta's theorem. Since I have been working
            on a real project for a year now, I have experience of working in a
            team. My main goal is to achieve a high level of knowledge in the
            field of web development Over the past three years, I have developed
            in such areas as data engineering, development of the server-side of
            applications and the user-side. I also have knowledge in the field of
            deploying servers, creating docker containers.
